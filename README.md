# Discord.js Bot TS Template

Just a little template for creating a Discord.js bot using Typescript.

## Usage

1. `git clone https://github.com/NFrid/dbot && cd dbot`
2. `yarn`
3. `yarn start`

You also might want to use ESLint, Prettier or something, but I've usually got
all of it on my text editor setup or IDE. You're probably not a kid, figure it
out somehow...
